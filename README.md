# Machine Learning

Recommended preparation: Python programming, Calculus II, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics.<br>


# Course Description:

This course provides a broad introduction to applied machine learning models and algorithms. This course will introduce models and algorithms through concrete working examples with a moderate amount of theory. Python will be used as the primary programming language for this course, together with its main scientific libraries, in particular Sklearn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

# Topics include: 

1. Machine learning concepts; handling, cleaning, and preparing data,
2. Main categories of machine learning models,
3. Theory of optimizing a machine learning model,
4. Selecting and engineering features,
5. Selecting a model and tuning hyper-parameter using cross-validation


# Course Objectives:

1. Handle large volume of data using python scientific libraries.

2. Understand the concepts and procedures for popular machine learning algorithms.

3. Given a particular learning task, build a machine learning model and train the model on the training dataset.

4. Tuning a machine learning model to improve its performance.
